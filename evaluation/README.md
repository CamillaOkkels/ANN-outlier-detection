# HNSW with outlier detection methods

This describes the experiments carried out in the paper 

> On the Design of Scalable Outlier Detection Methods Using Approximate Nearest Neighbor Graphs, Camilla Birch Okkels, Martin Aum√ºller & Arthur Zimek, SISAP 2024. 

For the experiments to run, the modified version of hnswlib <../hnswlib> needs to be installed on the system. Furthermore, baselines are running using [PyOD](https://github.com/yzhao062/pyod).
Please run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install these dependencies. 

## Data preparation

**describe how to obtain all the datasets**

## Experiments

You can carry out all experiments in the paper by running `bash experiments.sh`.

**what does the user have to do after running the experiments? move some csv files around**?

This will create the individual csv files that are used in the analysis. The evaluation is present in the jupyter notebook `evaluation/`.
